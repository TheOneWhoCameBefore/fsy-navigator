## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Configuration

### Firebase Setup Required:
1. **Create Firebase Project**
   - Enable Anonymous Authentication
   - Create Firestore database
   - Configure security rules

2. **Update firebase-config.js**
   ```javascript
   export const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "your-api-key",
     authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com", 
     projectId: "your-project-id",
     storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "123456789",
     appId: "your-app-id"
   };
   
   export const appId = "your-unique-app-id";
   export const initialAuthToken = null;
   ```

3. **Firestore Security Rules**
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/{collection}/{document} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Firebase Hosting (Recommended)
```bash
npm run build
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init hosting
firebase deploy
```

### Option 2: Static Hosting (Netlify/Vercel/etc.)
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to hosting provider
```
